# Email-Application
Email App written in Java
Email Application
Scenario: You have to create email accounts for new hires with the below specifications:
•	Generate an email with the following syntax: fistName.lastName@department.company.com
•	Determine the department (sales, development, accounting), if none leave blank
•	Generate a random String for a password
•	Have set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define an alternate email address
•	Have get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity
Here’s the outline of the App
Outline the App
I will create 2 classes: EmailApp for main, and Email for implementation
We don’t want the users to access our variables, so we set them to private. 
To implement the specifications, we need the following to be implemented:
 
        //Constructor to receive the first name and last name
	
	//Ask for the department
	
	//Generate a random password
	
	//Set the mailbox capacity
	
	//Set the alternate email
	
	//Change the password

Now, we finish the outline for this app
